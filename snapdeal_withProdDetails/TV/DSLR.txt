_____________________
Today, one cannot think of buying a DSLR camera which does not have a recording function. However, it was not so few years ago when Nikon D90 was launched. Nikon D90 was the first single lens reflex camera from the company that had video recording function. And, with its expressive and exquisite DX format image sensor it completely revolutionised the photographic circuits around the world.Â  The impact it made on the image capturing quality was so immense that it became favourite with advanced level photographers which later won it Best D-SLR Award in Advanced Category from TIPA. Though many new models have hit the market since then, but D90 still holds its ground in delivering the best and bestowing an amateur with a power of professional photography.
